# Spotify Clone (using React) @ Epicode
Made for the end of the Unit 3 Week 3.

## Description
Refactored an old Spotify project with React and Redux.

## API fetched inside the project
To get all the songs:  
 https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/search?q={query}  
`(example: https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/search?q=queen)`

## Main functions
• When you click on the cover of a song, it will be placed in the lower left side of the player ready to be played  
• Next to each song there's a “Like” button. The status reflect the one saved in Redux  
• A working player that reproduce the selected song  
• Searchbar to search your favourite artist in the API

## Store Key
I decided to hide my super secret token into an `.env` file, if you decide to fork this project remember to create one too!
